# WingTechBot MK3 - Architecture Analysis

## 🏗️ System Overview

WingTechBot MK3 is a modern full-stack Discord bot application built with TypeScript, following **hexagonal architecture** (ports and adapters) principles. The system is organized as a monorepo with clear separation of concerns across multiple packages.

## 📦 Package Architecture

### Monorepo Structure

The project uses a **monorepo pattern** with clear package boundaries:

- **Backend Package**: Express.js API and Discord bot functionality
- **Frontend Package**: React web application with modern tooling
- **Types Package**: Shared TypeScript types and validation schemas
- **Documentation Package**: Developer documentation site

This structure enables:
- **Shared code** between packages
- **Independent development** of each package
- **Consistent tooling** across the entire project
- **Simplified dependency management**

## 🎯 Backend Architecture (Hexagonal)

The backend follows **hexagonal architecture** with four distinct layers, each with clear responsibilities and dependencies.

### Layer Structure

The hexagonal architecture is organized into four concentric layers:

1. **Core Layer** (Innermost) - Pure business logic
2. **Application Layer** - Use cases and orchestration
3. **Adapter Layer** - Input/output adapters
4. **Infrastructure Layer** (Outermost) - Technical mechanisms

### Layer Responsibilities

#### Core Layer
- **Pure business logic** with no external dependencies
- Domain entities with business rules and validation
- Domain services and use cases
- Repository interfaces (ports)
- Domain-specific errors and exceptions

#### Application Layer
- **Application contracts** and orchestration
- API version management and contracts
- Route configurations and application logic
- Discord command and event handlers
- Application services and query handlers
- **No HTTP or infrastructure concerns**

#### Adapter Layer
- **Input/Output adapters** connecting external world to application
- HTTP controllers and presenters
- Repository implementations
- Service implementations
- **Clean separation** between different adapter types

#### Infrastructure Layer
- **Technical mechanisms** and frameworks
- HTTP routing and middleware
- Database connections and configuration
- Discord bot setup and configuration
- **No business logic or domain concerns**

## 🔄 Request Flow Patterns

### API Request Flow

The request flow follows a **unidirectional data flow** pattern:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Express app receives HTTP request
2. **Adapter Layer**: Controller validates and transforms request
3. **Application Layer**: Use case orchestrates business logic
4. **Core Layer**: Domain service executes business rules
5. **Adapter Layer**: Presenter transforms domain entities to API format
6. **Infrastructure Layer**: HTTP response is sent

### Discord Event Flow

Discord events follow a similar pattern:

1. **Infrastructure Layer**: Discord.js receives event
2. **Adapter Layer**: Event handler processes event
3. **Application Layer**: Command/event use case executes
4. **Core Layer**: Domain logic is applied
5. **Infrastructure Layer**: Bot responds to Discord

## 🎨 Frontend Architecture (Component-Driven)

### Architecture Principles

The frontend follows **component-driven architecture** with:

- **Functional components** with hooks
- **State management** with Zustand
- **Type safety** throughout the application
- **Modern React patterns** and best practices

### State Management Strategy

The frontend uses **Zustand** for state management, providing:
- **Simple, lightweight** state management
- **TypeScript support** with full type safety
- **Easy integration** with React hooks
- **Minimal boilerplate** compared to Redux

### Component Architecture

Components are organized by:
- **Reusability**: Common components for shared UI elements
- **Domain**: Feature-specific components
- **Complexity**: Simple presentational vs. complex container components

## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Design Principles

The database follows **relational design principles** with:

- **Normalized schema** to reduce data redundancy
- **Proper indexing** for performance
- **Foreign key relationships** for data integrity
- **Audit trails** with timestamps

### Technology Stack

- **PostgreSQL**: Production-ready relational database
- **Prisma**: Database ORM and migration management
- **Kysely**: Type-safe SQL query builder
- **Database migrations**: Version-controlled schema changes

### Data Access Patterns

The application uses **repository pattern** for data access:
- **Repository interfaces** in the core layer
- **Repository implementations** in the adapter layer
- **Type-safe queries** with Kysely
- **Transaction management** for data consistency

## 🔌 API Design Patterns

### Versioned API System

The API follows a **versioned architecture** with:

- **Multiple API versions** for backward compatibility
- **Type-safe contracts** with validation
- **Automatic documentation** generation
- **Clean deprecation** paths

### RESTful Design

The API follows **REST principles**:
- **Resource-based URLs**
- **Standard HTTP methods**
- **Consistent response formats**
- **Proper status codes**

### Request/Response Patterns

All API endpoints follow consistent patterns:
- **Standardized error responses**
- **Validation error details**
- **Pagination for list endpoints**
- **Filtering and sorting options**

## 🤖 Discord Bot Architecture

### Bot Integration

The Discord bot is **integrated into the backend** and follows the same architectural patterns:

- **Event-driven architecture** for Discord events
- **Command pattern** for slash commands
- **State management** for bot interactions
- **Error handling** and logging

### Voice System Design

The voice system uses a **simple, focused architecture**:

- **Clean interface** that abstracts Discord.js complexity
- **State management** for voice sessions
- **Error handling** for voice operations
- **Resource management** for audio playback

## 🔧 Configuration Management

### Configuration Strategy

Configuration follows **environment-based patterns**:

- **Environment variables** for configuration
- **Type-safe configuration** access
- **Validation** on application startup
- **Default values** for development

### Security Considerations

- **Sensitive data** stored in environment variables
- **No hardcoded secrets** in source code
- **Configuration validation** prevents misconfiguration
- **Environment-specific** configurations

## 🧪 Testing Architecture

### Testing Strategy

The application uses a **layered testing approach**:

- **Unit tests** for isolated components
- **Integration tests** for component interactions
- **End-to-end tests** for complete workflows
- **API tests** for endpoint validation

### Testing Patterns

- **Test-driven development** for critical business logic
- **Mocking strategies** for external dependencies
- **Test data management** with fixtures
- **Coverage reporting** for quality assurance

## 🚀 Deployment Architecture

### Containerization Strategy

The application uses **Docker** for deployment:

- **Multi-stage builds** for optimized images
- **Environment-specific** configurations
- **Health checks** for monitoring
- **Resource limits** for stability

### Deployment Patterns

- **Stateless services** for horizontal scaling
- **Database migrations** for schema updates
- **Environment-specific** configurations
- **Monitoring and logging** integration

## 🎯 Key Architectural Benefits

### 1. **Clean Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic isolated in core layer
